Genius Docs is a tecnical writing platform started By Roman Rand.
Later on, Genius Docs plans on exclusively supporting small writers and collegiate students.

## #Status Update

The website, and brand, is currently in development. For those so lucky to be reading this, I made some fun themes for you all at the bottom of the page!

Here's our development progress over the last few months:

```chart-bar
monthly-sales
```

And here's our technology stack distribution:

```chart-pie
browser-share
```

```js
haveFun(true);
```

## A glance into the future

WE MEAN IT!!! Genius Docs plans on supporting exclusively small writers, undergraduates/masters, and vetted self-taught developers.
The discord is under works, but will be the subject of the next *daily* update

```js
empowerStudents(always);
```

## How can you help?

Keep your eyes peeled for the next update, it might include a link to our discord.
We're going to need all hands on deck, see you around!
