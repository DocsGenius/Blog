DocsGenius is a blog started By Roman Rand.
Later on, DocsGenius plans on exclusively supporting small writers and students.

## #Status Update

The website is currently in development. For those so lucky to be reading this, I made some fun themes for you all at the bottom of the page!

```js
haveFun(true);
```

## A glance into the future

Docs Genius plans on supporting exclusively small writers, undergraduates/masters, and self-taught developers.
The discord is under works, but will be the subject of the next *daily* update

```js
empowerStudents(always);
```

## How can you help?

Keep your eyes peeled for the next update, it might include a link to our discord.
We're going to need all hands on deck, see you around!
