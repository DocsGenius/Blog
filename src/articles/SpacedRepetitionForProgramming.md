Spaced Repetition is a method of learning that has been shown to be effective in a variety of contexts.

## What is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced Repetition System (SRS) is a method of learning. The technique uses specific intervals of time to review material in order to improve retention. When retention per problem is improved, you spend less time forgetting and more time learning.

## How does it work exactly?

Well some systems vary, but the most general formula is actually quite familiar!
```txt
Formula : e * level
```

Where e is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828), and level is the number of times the problem has been reviewed.

## Why is it effective?

Spaced Repetition is effective because of how your brain remembers information, with recall difficulty increasing as time passes -- the more difficulty the more importance your brain allots to the information.

## How can you use this for programming?

It's an interesting question, that's not quite exposed to programmers... Traditionally, we study programming by Project Based Learning, where we learn by doing. This is a great way to learn, but it's not the best way to learn once you've done everything in projects. Spaced Repetition can be used to expand upon the finer details of programming, for instance in Java one might be interested in learning about the structure of an Object.

For those who might now be curious, or looking to see if they remember;
A Java Object is a class that has been instantiated, consisting of fields and methods. In memory the Object is stored as a collection of bytes, representing the header, the fields, and the padding.
The header consists of a reference to the class, the hash code, and the lock word, and GC (Garbage Collection) data.
The fields are the actual data of the object, and the padding is used to align the object to the memory.

That sounds like a lot, but it's actually not that bad... Spaced Repetition can be used to learn about the structure of an Object, and the formula can be used to determine how often to review the Object's structure.
You can stack this up onto an entire Java interface at a time, and keep a mapping of the hierarchy you are viewing at any given time for assistance when you struggle!

## Not many apps for this however...

The current implementations are not intended for studying programming, but rather any given context. Two current apps stood out when I was researching options, but for all intents and purposes I only found Anki to be a good fit for programming due to it's Open Source nature. The other app was Mochi, which is a paid app. I've started working with Anki more and more, and I've found it to be a better tool for studying programming.

## Conclusion

Spaced Repetition is a powerful tool for learning, and it can be used to expand upon the finer details of programming.
