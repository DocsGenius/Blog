# Genius Docs site
This is the source code for the Genius Docs website. It is a static website built with React and Vite.

## Welcome!

I'm Roman, and I have within the last three months fallen in love with technical reading. What started with a challenge to read the entire Rust guide in a weekend, has now become a passion for me. I'm here to share my journey with you, and to help others find helpful resources.

## If you want to write, look no further!

This website has a contact form that you can use to reach out to me. I'm here to help you on your journey to technical writing. Whether you're looking to learn to write, or you're looking to improve your writing, I'm here to help, granted I still get 70s on Grammarly before I revise my work..

## If you want to contribute, look no further!

Seriously, the contact form is for you! I'm building a discord at the moment with people who are interested, and will publicize it at the right moment. But it's never too soon to join!
